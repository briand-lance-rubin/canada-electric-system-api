app/:

Houses the core application logic.
Each major component is placed in its own file for modularity and maintainability.
tests/:

Contains unit tests for individual modules to ensure reliability.
Separate files for testing each module keep the test suite organized.
main.py:

Entry point for the FastAPI application. It initializes and runs the app.
requirements.txt:

Lists all project dependencies for easy setup using pip install -r requirements.txt.
README.md:

Provides an overview of the project, how to set it up, and usage instructions.
.gitignore:

Includes files and directories to ignore in version control, such as __pycache__/, venv/, or database files.
This structure ensures that the project is organized, modular, and scalable. Let me know if you'd like help creating or modifying these files!
